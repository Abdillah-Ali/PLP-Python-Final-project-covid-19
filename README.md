# Covid Data Exploration Project

## Description

This project explores Covid-19 data from various sources to identify trends and insights related to the spread and impact of the virus. The data is cleaned, preprocessed, and analyzed using Python and various data analysis libraries. The project aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the pandemic's effects.

## Objectives

*   Clean and preprocess Covid-19 data to ensure data quality and consistency.
*   Explore the data to identify key trends and patterns, such as infection rates, mortality rates, and vaccination rates.
*   Visualize the data using charts and graphs to communicate insights effectively to a broad audience.
*   Document the data exploration process and findings in a clear and concise manner.

## Tools and Libraries Used

*   Python
*   Pandas
*   Matplotlib
*   Seaborn

## How to Run/View the Project

1.  Make sure you have installed the required libraries.
2.  Run the `data_exploration.py` script to generate the plots and insights.
3.  View the generated plots (`.png` files) and insights (`insights.txt`) to understand the trends and patterns in the data.
